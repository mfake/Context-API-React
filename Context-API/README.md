To install Bootstrap version 5.3.2 using npm, you can use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

npm install bootstrap@5.3.2

This command will install Bootstrap version 5.3.2 and add it to your project's dependencies in the node_modules folder. Make sure to run this command in the root directory of your project.

After installing Bootstrap, you can import it into your project's JavaScript or stylesheets as needed. For example, in a JavaScript file or a component where you want to use Bootstrap components:

import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';

This line imports the Bootstrap CSS file into your project. Adjust the import statement based on your project structure and requirements.

Note: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before running the npm install command.
